# Musicbar - redux

Based on adarshpunj Musicbar app but heavily repurposed 

* The player component has been stripped down and a database has been added to keep track of song. 
* The app now has a import and filter function that can scan a playlist and export the new songs in the playlist into a new playlist titled 'New songs {week of the year} - {year}'.
* The tool also provided functions to tag songs and artists as liked or disliked in "Music". The playlist scanner will exclude any songs where the artist is disliked.

Todo
* Add a shuffle feature that plays all the song you have liked.
